 * why the marker and the tag are worded as a report rather than a verdict. Suppressing only the

 * all of them, and it was written when the predicate above matched `drug_reference` alone:
 * *"Clinical reference data — not this patient’s record."* Widening the predicate to the whole
 * `reference` group carried that sentence onto the other two unchanged, and on the measured

 * The backend is explicit that such a finding is "computed rather than quoted from a dataset",
 * so calling it reference data is wrong about the one citation in that answer that is entirely
 * about this patient.
 *
 * This is a difference in WORDING only. Every kind still gets the same treatment the backend
 * requires of the group: no grounding verdict, no navigation target, the same neutral tag. The
 * README's "must not treat the `reference`-group types differently" is aimed at a client that
 * keys the badge, the label or the navigation on `resourceType` and drops a type into a default
 * branch — which is why this, like the label map, is a total `Record` with an explicit `other`.
